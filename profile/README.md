# TextRP
## Unified Messaging Powered by XRPL

TextRP is the world’s first Web3-enabled messaging platform built for the XRP Ledger (XRPL).
It fuses the battle-tested Matrix open standard (via a heavily modified Synapse homeserver) with native XRPL capabilities so your XRP wallet address becomes your universal identity. Send encrypted messages, unlock premium channels & themes with NFTs, pay for messaging credits in XRP or any XRPL token, and even relay messages to any XRP address — even if the recipient isn’t on TextRP yet.

## Core Features
Wallet-native identity & login (XUMM / XRPL)
NFT-driven customization — hold Feature Pack or partner NFTs to unlock private channels (Slack, Twitter DMs, Discord, LinkedIn, etc.), themes, and sticker packs
Unified Inbox — SMS/MMS (US/Canada via Twilio), Twitter, Discord, Slack, and in-app Matrix chats in one beautiful UI
XRPL Message Relay — send to any XRP address; non-users receive a micro-transaction notification and are auto-onboarded on first login
End-to-end encryption by default
Pay-per-use credits bought directly with XRP or other XRPL tokens
Privacy-first — no phone number or email required
